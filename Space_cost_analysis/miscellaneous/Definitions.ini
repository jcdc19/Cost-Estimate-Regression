total_maintenance_cost_fy2020_musd — cumulative maintenance cost over the full mission life; increases year over year due to aging
disposal_cost_fy2020_musd — cost to deorbit or move the spacecraft to a graveyard orbit at end of life
total_lcc_fy2020_musd — total life cycle cost: development + production + total ops + total maintenance + disposal; the sum of everything

mission_type — repeated here for easy filtering without a join
orbit_class — same
fiscal_year — the specific year this row represents
phase — what lifecycle phase this year falls in: Development/Production, Operations, or Disposal
development_spend_musd — amount spent on development activities in this fiscal year; follows a bell-curve profile peaking mid-development
production_spend_musd — amount spent on manufacturing in this fiscal year; overlaps the last two years of development
ops_spend_musd — ground operations spending in this fiscal year; constant annual rate during the operational phase
maintenance_spend_musd — maintenance spending in this fiscal year; grows slightly each year due to the aging factor
disposal_spend_musd — disposal spending; non-zero only in the year after end of life
total_annual_cost_musd — sum of all five spend columns for that year; used to build S-curves


satellite_components.csv — one row per program per subsystem (10 subsystems × 50 programs = 500 rows)

program_name — joins to programs table
mission_type — for filtering
orbit_class — for filtering
wbs_id — Work Breakdown Structure identifier (1.1 through 1.10); standard aerospace cost accounting structure
subsystem — the name of the subsystem: Structures & Mechanisms, Thermal Control, Power, Propulsion, ADCS, Command & Data Handling, Communications/RF, Payload/Instruments, Software, or Integration Assembly & Test
subsystem_mass_kg — mass allocated to this subsystem; zero for Software and IA&T which have no physical mass
subsystem_power_w — power draw allocated to this subsystem; zero for Structures, Software, and IA&T
subsystem_dev_cost_fy2020_musd — development cost for this subsystem; all ten values sum exactly to development_cost in the programs table
subsystem_prod_cost_fy2020_musd — production cost for this subsystem; all ten values sum exactly to production_cost in the programs table
subsystem_total_cost_fy2020_musd — dev + prod cost for this subsystem combined
year_development_start — repeated from programs table for convenience

satellite_production_detail.csv — one row per program, breaking down how production cost is spent

program_name — joins to programs table
mission_type — for filtering
orbit_class — drives labor and material ratios; Interplanetary missions are more labor-intensive, LEO missions use more commodity materials
