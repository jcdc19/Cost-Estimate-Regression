SPACE SYSTEMS CER PORTFOLIO — PROJECT OBJECTIVES & STEPS
==========================================================


1. DATA FOUNDATION
------------------
- Open each CSV and verify row counts match expectations (50, 840, 500, 50)
- Sum subsystem dev costs per program, confirm they match development_cost in programs file
- Sum subsystem prod costs per program, confirm they match production_cost
- Sum yearly spend per program across all cost columns, confirm they match total_lcc_fy2020_musd
- Write up a one-page data dictionary describing every table, key columns, units, and how tables join


2. CER REGRESSION MODELS
-------------------------
- Plot development cost vs. dry mass on a log-log scale to visually confirm the power-law relationship
- Fit a simple log-log OLS regression: log(dev_cost) = a + b*log(mass)
- Expand to a multivariate model adding log(power) and log(design_life)
- Check residuals, R², and prediction intervals
- Repeat the regression segmented by mission type (GEO vs LEO, science vs comms)
- Document your CER equations in the form: Cost = C * Mass^a * Power^b * Life^c


3. LIFECYCLE COST ANALYSIS
---------------------------
- For each program, compute cumulative spend year by year across all cost categories
- Plot individual S-curves for a representative sample (one per mission type)
- Plot an aggregate S-curve across all 50 programs
- Calculate what percentage of total LCC is post-launch (ops + maintenance + disposal) — highlight this finding
- Identify which mission types have the worst ops-to-development cost ratios


4. WBS COST BREAKDOWN
----------------------
- Calculate each subsystem's share of total development cost per program
- Average those shares by mission type and orbit class
- Identify the top three cost drivers for each mission type
- Flag any subsystems where cost share varies significantly across programs — those are worth explaining
- Create a stacked bar or treemap showing WBS cost distribution


5. ESTIMATING TOOL
-------------------
- Use your regression coefficients from Objective 2 to build the estimating formula
- Build a Python script (or notebook) where a user can input mass, power, orbit, and design life
- Output a point estimate plus a low/high confidence range based on your regression prediction interval
- Add a lookup for orbit-class ops and maintenance cost so it outputs full LCC, not just development cost
- Test it against 3-4 known programs in your dataset to show accuracy


6. PRESENTATION LAYER
----------------------
- Write a one-page methodology summary explaining your CER approach and key assumptions
- Summarize the three most interesting findings from your analysis
- Create 4-5 charts: S-curve, CER scatter with fit line, WBS breakdown, ops vs dev cost comparison
- Frame everything as "here is the question, here is the analysis, here is what I'd tell leadership"
- Package everything into a clean PDF or notebook you can walk someone through in 10 minutes
